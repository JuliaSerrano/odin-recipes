        <li>4 small-medium zucchini about 1¾ pounds</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Buffalo Wing Sauce not regular hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="centered_list">
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9x13 inch baking
                dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
                Add the chicken and break it apart with a wooden spoon.
                Cook for 7-9 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through,
                stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the buffalo
                wing sauce.</li>
            <li>As the chicken cooks, cut the zucchini in half, lengthwise.
                Use a spoon to scoop the seeds and center out of each zucchini
                half, leaving a ¼ inch thick zucchini boat. Place the zucchini
                in the baking dish cut-side up.</li>
            <li>Spoon the chicken mixture into the zucchini boats. Sprinkle the
                zucchini evenly with the cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil. Bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
